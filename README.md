How the System should work:
  1. Start the Server
  2. After compiling the Client, enter the port you intend to use for the P2P portion
  3. You will be presented will the options of:  ADD, LOOKUP, LIST, GET, and EXIT
  4. If you enter ADD:  you must then enter the RFC Number you want to add into the server, then enter the title of the RFC
  5. If you enter LOOKUP: you must then enter the RFC Number you want to search for within the server, then enter the title of the RFC
  6. If you enter LIST: The server will present you with all the RFC's currently within the system.
  7. If you enter GET: You must present the peer's hostname, RFC number, and the host's OS
  8. If you enter EXIT: The connection will be closed to the Server
  9. If you dont enter any of these commands, you will be prompted with the message of "Invalid command. Please try again."
